This project involves selecting the most profitable location for a new oil well on behalf of the OilyGiant mining company. The task requires analyzing data from three regions to determine which offers the greatest potential for profit.

The steps include:

Analyzing oil well parameters from each region, such as oil quality and reserve volume

Building a regression model to predict the volume of reserves in new wells

Identifying the wells with the highest predicted reserves

Selecting the region that yields the highest total expected profit based on those predictions

The model will be used to guide investment decisions by estimating profitability and assessing associated risks. To evaluate potential outcomes, the analysis incorporates the bootstrapping technique to simulate profits and quantify uncertainty.
